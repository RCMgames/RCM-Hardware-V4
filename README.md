# RCM-Hardware-V4
* 4 motors and 7 servos OR 6 motors and 3 servos
* 3 additional input only pins
* runs from 5 NiMH AA batteries OR (_need to test_) 4.5-22v with the addition of voltage regulators (see list of components)
* [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic#faqs) connectors OR two more GPIO pins
* all components are hand-solderable through-hole parts except for the Qwiic connectors

Compatible with 38 pin devkitC ESP32 boards

### Alternatives
* An upgrade from [the original 3 versions of RCM board](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM_hardware_documentation_and_user_guide)

* Here are smaller and more powerful RCM boards: [BYTE](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM-Hardware-BYTE) and [Nibble](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM-Hardware-Nibble)

## Options for purchasing

* PCBWay link (coming soon, after testing is complete) (PCBWay will give me a commission without increasing the price for you). (approximately $5 for 5 boards and manufacturing takes 1-7 days).
* send the gerbers to a PCB manufacturer of your choice (details you may be asked for: min hole: 0.3mm, min track/spacing 6/6mil, 1 oz Cu outer)
